Anorak
=====

*Anorak is currently an alpha release. There may be severe bugs in it and at any given time it may not work at all.*

Anorak is a PVR for newsgroup users. It watches for new episodes of your favorite anime shows and when they are posted it downloads them, sorts and renames them. It currently supports fanzub.com and retrieves show information from aniDB.net.

Features include:

* automatically retrieves new episode nzb files
* sends NZBs directly to SABnzbd and categorizes them properly
* available for any platform, uses simple HTTP interface
* can notify Plex when new episodes are downloaded
* pick your favorite release group for subs
* allows easy override of search terms in case release name is different than the aniDB official name

Anorak makes use of the following projects:

* [anidb][anidb]
* [webpy][webpy]
